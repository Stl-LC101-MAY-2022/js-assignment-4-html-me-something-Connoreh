            <p class="funParagraph" id="testP">  My journey started on November 23, 2019 at Lambert International Airport. Clay, a good friend of mine, was studying a semester abroad in Spain. I was lucky enough to be able to take the week of Thanksgiving and visit him. There we spent the week in Madrid exploring the city, while he was in class. Then on Thursday, we would leave for Munich, Germany, and explore their famous Christmas markets that had just popped up. My first flight left at 1 pm to go to Philadelphia. From there I had about a 4 hour layover before finally leaving to go to Madrid! </p>

            <h2>Day 1 - Arrival</h2>
            <p> After about an 8 hour flight across the Atlantic, we started descending into Madrid. Madrid has a unique landscape. When flying into the airport, strong winds were blowing back and forth. There are beautiful mountains on the sides, like the airport sits in a valley. To get to the city center, the train system is a cheap and quick route. For this part of the trip, my air bnb was located in a neighborhood called Embajadores. Luckily we were very close to transit, and in Madrid it's incredibly easy to travel most anywhere.</p>
            <p> That afternoon, we explored the city by walking through the Cortes(financial) district, the Plaza de Cibeles, and Plaza Mayor, before getting dinner at a nice sandwhich spot called 100 Montaditos. Because it was late November, all the city decorations for Christmas were up making for a beautiful night. The Plaza Mayor is close to an incredible marketplace called Mercado de San Miguel with all different types of foods and pastries. We finished the night grabbing some hot chocolate at a small cafe, and then walking by the Royal Palace at night before heading back to the apartment.</p>

            <h2>Day 2- The Royal Palace, La Mucca, and lights!</h2>
            <p> After being out fairly late the night before, we woke up around 10 for an 11 AM tour of the Royal Palace. This was home to the Royal family of Spain. Technically it is still a residence of theirs, but they do not live their anymore. The palace itself is massive and gorgeuous. It has huge staircases with paintings and carvings all along the ceilings. Rooms where subjects would wait for an audience with the king. Rooms for dining and sleeping quarters. The whole place was gigantic, and overlooked an equally enormous garden.</p>

            </div>
            </div>
            <p>To the side of the Royal Palace, is the Cathedral de la Almudena. Inside of it are many beautiful artifacts from the history of the church in Madrid. One in particular is a statue of Mary called the Virgin of Almudena, which legend has it was hidden inside of the walls of the city when the city was conquered by Muslims. When Madrid was retaken by Christians, they found the statue hidden inside the wall. This Cathedral is also a crypt many royal family members throughout Spain's history.</p>

           </div>
            <p> After touring the museum and palace, we walked around the royal garden that the palace overlooks, and followed with lunch at a place very similar to a Chipotle or Qdoba here. Following lunch, we rested for a bit, then did more walking throught the city plazas with all the Christmas lights. Our dinner was at La Mucca, a great restaurant. We ordered some sangria, and Iberian ham, which is amazing. It has a little sweetness to it, unlike any ham in the states. The taste supposedly comes from the diet of the pigs. Then for the main course I ordered a squid topped with a glaze.</p>

            <h2> Day3 - Egyptian temple, Real Madrid, National Archeological Museum </h2>
            <p>To start off Day 3, my friend had class for most the day, so I decided to go to the Ancient Egyptian Temple called the Temple of Debod that was moved to Madrid from Egypt because of floods endangering it. The government gifted it to Madrid. I was amazed and completely surprised to see anything Egyptian in Madrid. The temple was originally built in the 2nd century BC, so inside of it are all these carvings that are amazing to be able to see.</p>
               <div class="column">
                  <img src="images/TempleDebod.jpeg" alt="Temple Debod" width="500" height="500">
                  <p>Temple Debod</p>
               </div>
            <p>The Temple Debod is not too far from the stadium where Real Madrid plays, so after the temple, I ventured over and tried to book a tour of the stadium. Unfortuantely no tours were available that day, but I did get to see the team club house, and the stadium itself was very beautiful. After the stadium I grabbed lunch at a sandwhich spot recomended by my friend. It was run by an immigrant from Venezuela, and he was incredibly friendly to everybody but me specically as a tourist as well. The sandwhich, which was similar to a Cuban sandwhich, was also amazing.</p>
            <p> Following this was most likely my favorite part of Madrid. The National Archeological Museum. They had relics from millions of years ago when humans were just migrating from Africa into Europe. There were items from all types of civilizations that either traveled through the area or conquered it at some point. The span of artifacts and history in the museum could have kept me there for days! </p>

            <p> Finally, I met up with my friend again, and we grabbed a drink at a restaurant before heading to dinner, where I had a canoli, which was on par with the rest of the great food on the trip. We finished dinner off with a desert alcohol, and then went to the famous San Gines, which serves amazing churros and chocolate sauce. </p>

            <h2> Day 4 - El Escorial </h2>
            <p>On Day 4, we took a train through the countryside to see El Escorial. This is where the royal palace used to be, before the new one was made in Madrid. The train ride to the town, San Lorenzo, was beautiful. We were surrounded by pretty countryside and into the distance were pretty snowcapped mountains. As we got closer to El Escorial, we climbed higher and higher into the mountains. </p>
            
            <div class="column">

            </div>
            <p>Once there, we grabbed a quick bite for lunch, and headed to our self guided tour of the old royal palace. The palace itself is also a big crypt for members of the royal family, like the Cathedral next to the current Palace. El Escorial is just as beautiful and massive, but the architecture has a marked difference from the newer built palace.</p>

            <p>After our tour of the palace and walkign around the town, it was time to head back for our train ride back into Madrid. The ride itself is about 45 minutes and it had been getting late, so we took the opportunity to nap on the train. For Dinner, we would end up getting a cheap &euro;1  taco place called Tacos El Pastor. It's open till late hours, so it is the perfect place to get amazing food after a night out. They have great margaritas too.</p>

            <h2>Day 5- Plaza de Cibeles, Retiro Park, and Flying to Munich!  </h2>
            <p>Our last day in Madrid! To start the day, we went to the top of the Cibeles Palace to get a great view of the city. Madrid is very spread out. Following the palace, we went to art museum, which was beautiful but unfortunately allowed no photos. We didn't have enough time to see everything becasue we were in a rush on our last day, so after seeing most of the museum, we left for retiro park which is a nice green area in the middle of the city. They have trees brought over from Louisiana back in the colonial times, which I thought was very interesting. </p>
            <div class="column">

            <p> After a lunch at the same sandwhich place as the first day, 100 Montaditos, it was time to pack and head to the airport and to Germany! Our flight got in late at night, so we took a train from the airport to the city center where our next air bnb was, and got settled in. Luckily for us, we were close to a nice restaurant that was open late, so we went over for a bite to eat and a beer in a big glass mug to enjoy it in true German fashion.</p>

            <h2>Day 6- Munich City Center, Christmas Markets, BMW Museum, and Hoffbrauhaus </h2>
            <p> We started our first day in Germany out walking to town square with all the Christmas markets set up. Munich has many beautiful cathedrals to visit with cool artifacts stored in most all of them. In the main city center, there is a big clock that you can climb to the top of and get an amazing view of the city. Conveniently, there are many places to eat around the city square, so we picked a place right in front of the clock tower and got some schnitzel.</p>
            <div>

            </div>
            <p>After lunch, we visited a few more cathedrals. One of the best parts of walking through the Christmas markets were the readily available mugs of gluvein, which is a warm mulled wine drink. It is amazing and the perfect cold winter drink. Once done walking through the city, we took a train ride out to the BMW museum, where we saw a ton of old and new cars and motorcycles.</p>

            <p> Finally back in the city center, we decided to finish the day with a quick bite of pizza from a random shop we found. It was New York style, and was delicious! Then came time for the best part of most anyone's trip to Munich, the Hofbrauhaus. We were able to try the dark and light beer that they have, and my friend got the Hefeweizen as well. The best part about Hofbrauhaus besides the beer is it is like a cafeteria hall, so you are seated at big tables or booths with other people. We were able to meet some awesome tourists from Hong Kong.</p>

            <h2> Day 7- Last Day in Munich</h2>
            <p> With it being our last day, we had alot to get done! First we visited a few more cathedrals, only after stopping by the markets for a nice glass of gluvein. There is no shortage in food in all different types, making it the ideal place for me to hang out.</p>
            <div class="column">

            </div>
            <p> For the second half of our day, we took a train our to Dauchau to visit the concentration camp that is now turned into a museum. The whole place has an incredibly sad feel to it. It is hard to see and believe the history of such a terrible place, but important to not forget. </p>
            <div>

            <p> After Dauchau, it was time to return to the city and get a bite to eat. We went to the same restaurant right in the town square because it was close and the place was great the first time we ate there. After dinner, we walked to an outdoor ice rink they had set up, which was incredible. Skating in such an old city surrounded by historical buildings and Christmas lights with the markets was amazing. </p>
